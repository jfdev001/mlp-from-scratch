# Multilayer Perceptron from Scratch

Here I implement the multilayer perceptron from "scratch" using `numpy`. The implementation is derived solely from the readings and sources referenced in the _References_ section of the `report.pdf`. I compare my implementation with a reference `tensorflow `implementation and make use of K-fold cross validation with the construction of confidence intervals to validate my models. The `report.pdf` also contains explanations on the foundational concepts of neural networks for personal elucidation.
